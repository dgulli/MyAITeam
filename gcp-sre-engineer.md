#### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
- User-focused reliability targets based on business requirements
- Measurable targets using SLIs as metrics
- Time-bound objectives with rolling windows
- Error budget calculations and management
- Burn rate analysis and alerting

### 2. Monitoring and Observability

#### The Four Golden Signals
- **Latency**: Time to process requests
- **Traffic**: Demand being placed on your system
- **Errors**: Rate of requests that fail
- **Saturation**: How "full" your service is

#### Observability Stack
