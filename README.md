## Installation

### Quick Install

Run the installation script to copy all agents to your Claude Code agents directory:

```bash
./install-agents.sh
```

### Manual Installation

Copy individual agent files to your Claude Code agents directory:

```bash
cp gcp-cloud-architect.md ~/.claude/agents/
cp gcp-terraform-engineer.md ~/.claude/agents/
cp adk-python-engineer.md ~/.claude/agents/
cp gcp-python-sdk-engineer.md ~/.claude/agents/
cp gcp-nodejs-sdk-engineer.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed and configured
- Access to Google Cloud Platform (for GCP-specific agents)
- Python 3.8+ (for Python-based agents)
- Node.js 16+ (for Node.js SDK agent)
- Terraform 1.5+ (for Terraform agent)

## How Agents Work Together

These agents are designed to complement each other in complex GCP projects:

1. **Architecture Design**: Start with the GCP Cloud Architect to design your solution following Well-Architected Framework principles
2. **Infrastructure Implementation**: Use the GCP Terraform Engineer to implement the architecture with Infrastructure as Code
3. **Application Development**: Use the GCP Python or Node.js SDK Engineers to build applications that interact with your GCP services
4. **AI Agent Development**: Leverage the ADK Python Engineer to build AI agents that enhance your platform

## Example Workflows

### Full-Stack GCP Application
```bash
# 1. Design the architecture
/agent gcp-cloud-architect
"Design a microservices platform with auto-scaling, monitoring, and data analytics"

# 2. Implement infrastructure
/agent gcp-terraform-engineer
"Create Terraform modules for the microservices platform using Fabric modules"

# 3. Build backend services
/agent gcp-python-sdk-engineer
"Create Python microservices using Cloud Run, Pub/Sub, and BigQuery"

# 4. Build frontend services
/agent gcp-nodejs-sdk-engineer
"Create Node.js API gateway with authentication and real-time features"

# 5. Add AI capabilities
/agent adk-python-engineer
"Build ADK agents for automated monitoring and customer support"
```

### Data Analytics Pipeline
```bash
# 1. Design data architecture
/agent gcp-cloud-architect
"Design a real-time data analytics pipeline for IoT data"

# 2. Provision data infrastructure
/agent gcp-terraform-engineer
"Create BigQuery datasets, Pub/Sub topics, and Dataflow jobs"

# 3. Build data processing
/agent gcp-python-sdk-engineer
"Create Python data processing pipelines with streaming and batch operations"

# 4. Build analytics dashboard
